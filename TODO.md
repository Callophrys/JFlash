Peak at answer or some second type of hint.
Another column for question type. E.g. kana, noun, verb, i-adjective, na-adjective, particle, etc.

Add expand/collapse all.
Get rid of the chime every time enter is pressed in questionaire.
Maybe an arrow or button that can be clicked to go next. E.g. when just browsing answers.
Maybe a cheat/peek control.
Leave kanji field blank if unknown. Default to hirigana if missing; even if hirigana is the response format.
