- [ ] Incorporate updates on question file edits without having to exit app.
- [ ] Make logs work in sections per session. Could create a show all option.
E.g. just show for active session.
- [ ] On-demand peak at answer or some second type of hint. Cheat/peek control.
- [ ] Allow kanji field blank if unknown. Default by displaying hirigana if kanji is
missing; even if hirigana is the response format.
- [ ] Think big files of a type and subset via first and/or second column and by count via app setting.
- [ ] Maybe put all settings in a menu bar or buttons.
- [ ] Maybe add a status bar at bottom.
- [ ] Convert to Avalonia.
- [x] Deal with stored selections when changing subset sizes and using (un)select all.
Also re-sizing can attempt adds when expanded files set already has same-named subset.
- [x] Using expand-collapse all is slow.
- [x] Have selection checkboxes work across panel width.
- [x] Handle subset size of 0 as "no subsets" and limit max size of max questions count of a file.
- [x] Handle romaji answers with hyphens as answers without hypens, e.g. one single word, and 
handle as multiple words or word parts with spaces instead, and ofc with the hyphen present.
- [ ] Issue inside shuffle. Seems related to having _00 selected.
