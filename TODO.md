- Incorporate updates on question file edits without having to exit app.
- Make logs work in sections per session. Could create a show all option.
E.g. just show for active session.
- On-demand peak at answer or some second type of hint. Cheat/peek control.
- Allow kanji field blank if unknown. Default by displaying hirigana if kanji is
missing; even if hirigana is the response format.
- Think big files of a type and subset via first column and by count via app setting.
- Maybe put all settings in a menu bar or buttons.
- Maybe add a status bar at bottom.
- Convert to Avalonia.
- Deal with stored selections when changing subset sizes and using (un)select all.
Also re-sizing can attempt adds when expanded files set already has same-named subset.
- Using expand-collapse all is slow.
- Have selection checkboxes work across panel width.
- Handle subset size of 0 as "no subsets" and limit max size of max questions count of a file.
- Next question button needs to render the chevron.
