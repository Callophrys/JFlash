- Make logs work in sections per session. Could create a show all option.
E.g. just show for active session.
- Peak at answer or some second type of hint.
- Maybe a cheat/peek control.
- Leave kanji field blank if unknown. Default by displaying hirigana if kanji is
missing; even if hirigana is the response format.
- Think big files of a type and subset via first column and by count via app setting.
